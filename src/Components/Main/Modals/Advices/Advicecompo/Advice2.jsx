                                    Support your body's natural calorie-burning process by engaging in activities like walking, swimming, or dancing regularly.
                                    Add simple strength training exercises like squats and lunges to your routine to build muscle and boost metabolism. Aim for

                                                        Drinking an adequate amount of water is essential for a well-functioning metabolism. Even mild dehydration can

                                                        Include lean protein sources in your meals, such as chicken, fish, beans, and tofu. Protein requires more energy

                                                        Incorporate strength training exercises into your fitness routine. Building muscle mass increases resting metabolic
                                                        rate, as muscle tissue burns more calories at rest than fat tissue.

                                                        Prioritize quality sleep. Lack of sleep can disrupt metabolic hormones and lead to weight gain. Aim for 7-9 hours of
                                                        sleep per night to support overall health and a healthy metabolism.

                                                        Consuming smaller, balanced meals more frequently throughout the day can help keep your metabolism active. This approach
                                                        prevents large spikes and drops in blood sugar levels.

                                                        Incorporate spicy foods like chili peppers into your meals. The compound capsaicin found in peppers may temporarily increase

                                                        Green tea contains antioxidants and catechins that may contribute to a modest increase in metabolism. Drinking a cup of green
