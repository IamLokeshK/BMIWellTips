                                    Devotion refers to a profound sense of commitment and reverence towards a spiritual practice, often
                                    involving a connection with a higher power or deity. In the context of seeking inner peace, devotion
                                    becomes a personal journey of connecting with one's spiritual beliefs, fostering a deep sense of tranquility
                                    and harmony. Engaging in devotional practices, such as prayer, meditation, or rituals, allows individuals to
                                    center their thoughts and emotions on a higher purpose, providing solace and a profound sense of peace within.
